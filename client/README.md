# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

. Set Up API Service Layer
Create functions in client/src/services/api.js for all backend endpoints (products, users, cart, orders, etc.).
Use Axios (already set up) for HTTP requests.
2. Products
Fetch product list and product details from /api/products and /api/products/:id.
Replace all sample product data in Products.jsx and ProductDetail.jsx with real API data.
3. Authentication
Implement login, register, and logout using /api/users/login and /api/users/register.
Store JWT in localStorage or cookies, and send it with each request.
Update AuthContext to use backend authentication and user roles.
4. Cart
Use backend endpoints for cart management (/api/cart).
Sync cart state in CartContext with backend.
5. Orders


# Frontend:
 Frontend Integration
 Validation and Error Handling
according to #file:README.md design a useful and feature rich ui with all the functionality for the college project #codebase frontend ui using react and is mern stack  Electomart : Home Appliances & Gadgets
MERN Stack Home Appliances & Gadgets it is singlevendow platrom and ui for all the functions also clean ui and professional theme with color definition and can be changed by changing one place



Based on your request and the codebase, here are the steps and relevant code for making a good frontend for your MERN stack Electomart project, focusing on the process and the files that implement each step:

---

### 1. Design the Homepage and Navbar

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` (Homepage UI)
- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (Main layout, includes navigation and theming)

> Note: `Navbar.jsx` is not used; navigation is handled in `Layout.jsx`.

**Codebase Details:**
- The homepage is implemented in `Home.jsx` with a hero section, featured products, and a "Shop Now" button.
- The navigation bar is implemented in `Layout.jsx` using Mantine's `AppShell.Navbar` and includes links to Home, Products, Orders, Profile, Admin, etc.

---

### 2. Set Up a Consistent Theme and Color System

**Relevant Files:**
- `tailwind.config.js` (Color palette and theme configuration)
- `src/index.css` (Tailwind import)
- `src/variable.css` (Note: All color variables are now managed via Tailwind config)

**Codebase Details:**
- Colors for light and dark mode are defined in `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.colors`.
- Tailwind is set up and imported in `index.css`.
- The UI uses Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling.

---

### 3. Implement Layout and Routing

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (AppShell layout, header, navbar, footer)
- `src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx` and `src/routes/router.js` (Routing setup)

**Codebase Details:**
- The `Layout` component wraps all pages, providing a consistent header, navigation, and footer.
- Routing is handled via React Router, with routes for Home, Products, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Orders, Profile, Login, Register, Admin, and NotFound.

---

### 4. Build Feature-Rich Pages

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/pages/Shop/Products.jsx` (Product listing with search)
- `src/pages/Shop/ProductDetail.jsx` (Product details)
- `src/pages/Shop/Cart.jsx` (Shopping cart)
- `src/pages/Shop/Checkout.jsx` (Checkout form)
- `src/pages/User/Profile.jsx` (User profile)
- `src/pages/User/Orders.jsx` (Order history)
- `src/pages/Admin.jsx` (Admin dashboard)

**Codebase Details:**
- Each page uses Tailwind classes for a clean, responsive UI.
- Product, cart, and order data are managed via React context (`CartContext.jsx`, `AuthContext.jsx`).

---

### 5. Add State Management and Context

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` (User authentication context)
- `src/contexts/CartContext.jsx` (Cart state context)

**Codebase Details:**
- Context providers wrap the app in `main.jsx` to provide global state for authentication and cart.

---

### 6. Integrate Theming and Dark Mode

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (Uses Mantine's `useMantineColorScheme` for dark/light mode toggle)
- `tailwind.config.js` (Dark mode enabled via `darkMode: 'class'`)

**Codebase Details:**
- Users can toggle between light and dark mode.
- All components use Tailwind's dark mode classes for consistent theming.

---

### 7. Ensure Reusability and Clean Code

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/components/common/Footer.jsx` (Reusable footer)
- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (Reusable layout)
- Use of context and hooks for state management

---

### 8. Connect to Backend and Handle API Calls

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/services/api.js` (Axios instance for API calls)

**Codebase Details:**
- API integration is set up for future backend connectivity.

---

### 9. Add Error Handling and Validation (Planned)

**Relevant Files:**
- Not fully implemented yet, but should be added to forms and API calls.

---

### 10. Polish UI/UX and Test Responsiveness

**Relevant Files:**
- All page and component files (use of Tailwind for responsive design)
