## Project Structure

| Area                | Main Files/Components                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Layout & Routing    | `src/components/common/Layout.jsx`, `src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx` |
| Theming             | `tailwind.config.js`, `src/index.css`                      |
| Pages               | `src/pages/Home.jsx`, `src/pages/Shop/Products.jsx`, etc.  |
| State Management    | `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`, `src/contexts/CartContext.jsx` |
| API Service         | `src/services/api.js`                                      |
| Reusable Components | `src/components/common/Footer.jsx`, `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` |

---

## Theming & Customization

- All theme colors are defined in `tailwind.config.js` for easy updates.
- Dark mode is enabled via Tailwind (`darkMode: 'class'`).
- UI uses Tailwind and Mantine for consistent, professional styling.

---

## API Integration

- All backend endpoints are accessed via functions in `src/services/api.js` using Axios.
- Auth, cart, products, orders, and user profile are fully integrated with backend APIs.
- JWT is stored in localStorage and sent with each request.

---

## Development Guidelines

- Use React functional components and hooks.
- Use context for global state (auth, cart).
- Keep UI clean and accessible; use Tailwind utility classes.
- Add error handling and loading states to all async operations.
- For new features, update the API service layer and relevant context/providers.

## Backend

See [`/server/README.md`](../server/README.md) for backend setup and API documentation.

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` (User authentication context)
- `src/contexts/CartContext.jsx` (Cart state context)

**Codebase Details:**
- Context providers wrap the app in `main.jsx` to provide global state for authentication and cart.

---

### 6. Integrate Theming and Dark Mode

- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (Uses Mantine's `useMantineColorScheme` for dark/light mode toggle)
- `tailwind.config.js` (Dark mode enabled via `darkMode: 'class'`)

**Codebase Details:**
- Users can toggle between light and dark mode.
- All components use Tailwind's dark mode classes for consistent theming.

---

### 7. Ensure Reusability and Clean Code

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/components/common/Footer.jsx` (Reusable footer)
- `src/components/common/Layout.jsx` (Reusable layout)
- Use of context and hooks for state management

---

### 8. Connect to Backend and Handle API Calls

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/services/api.js` (Axios instance for API calls)

**Codebase Details:**
- API integration is set up for future backend connectivity.

---

### 9. Add Error Handling and Validation (Planned)

**Relevant Files:**
- Not fully implemented yet, but should be added to forms and API calls.

---

### 10. Polish UI/UX and Test Responsiveness

**Relevant Files:**
- All page and component files (use of Tailwind for responsive design)
